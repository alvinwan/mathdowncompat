# MathDownCompat (MDC)
MathTex compatibility for in-browser markdown using MathJax, MathML, and/or images

Have delimited math formulas in your markdown? If you're fortunate enough to have control over the webpage containing your markdown, pretty math displays are just one `script` tag away, using MathJax. If otherwise, you're in a fix. This is where MDC comes in: pip install and with just one command, you'll have your math display ready to go in a jiffy. Math can be converted into one of the following alternatives:

1. MathML: a native markup language supported by Safari and Firefox
2. Images: All math is converted into images and saved to your local disk. You can configure a custom URL prefix, should you host the images on Github or elsewhere. (Automatic Imgur upload support coming soon)
